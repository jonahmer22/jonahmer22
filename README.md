# Hi there, I'm **jonahmer22**! :wave:

<!-- 
    banner needs to go here

I’m a student at the **University of Connecticut**, passionate about:
- **Systems programming & CPU simulations** (I love the nitty-gritty of C!)
- **Python** for quick prototyping and fun scripting
- **Linux** tinkering and exploring its limitless possibilities
- **Art & Hiking** when I step away from the keyboard

I’m constantly working on technical, open-source projects—everything I do is licensed under **GPL v3**. Check them out below!

## :wrench: My Projects & Work

**1. 8-bit Overture CPU**  
[**Repository Link**](https://github.com/jonahmer22/CPUArchitecture)
- A custom 8-bit CPU simulation to explore low-level computing concepts.

**2. Quantum CPU Simulation**  
[**Repository Link**](https://github.com/jonahmer22/Pure-Quanta)
- Delving into the world of quantum computing at a conceptual level.

**3. C Libraries in Progress**  
[**Repository Link**](https://github.com/jonahmer22/turbo-doodle)
- Building a WIP **machine learning library in C**.
- Other libraries to make development fun, fast, and open-source.

## :star: Achievements & Highlights

- **C Development**  
  Proud of my journey in systems-level programming and my ability to build reliable, performance-focused solutions.

- **Portfolio Website**  
  I’ve created a personal website (link below) to showcase my projects, blog about programming, and show off a teal-to-purple aesthetic!

- **Curious Explorer**  
  I enjoy **hiking**, **art**, and occasionally losing myself in the command line to figure out how everything ticks.
